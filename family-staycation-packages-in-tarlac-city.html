                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Stayed at Aces Private Resort with my family last March for my dad’s 60th birthday. We booked their family staycation package, which included the use of the big pool and a karaoke area. The villas were clean and the staff were polite, although we had to wait around 40 minutes for check-in since they were preparing our rooms. The property felt really private and secure, which was a big plus, and the kids loved the pool. I wish there were more food options on-site, but overall we had a relaxing weekend together. Would recommend for families who want privacy without driving too far.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">We tried Aces last December for a family reunion and honestly, the place surprised me. The photos didn’t do justice to how spacious the grounds are. We got a package for 12 people, and everything was set up before we arrived – towels, toiletries, and even a grill. Only issue we had was the WiFi was spotty, but that kind of forced us to hang out more offline, so not a huge deal. Loved how quiet it was at night. Staff checked in on us a couple of times, just to see if we needed anything. Would come back, probably next summer.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">I brought my two teens to Aces Private Resort last February, hoping for a break from the city. Booking was easy, but we went on a weekday so it was less busy. The main pool was really well maintained and the garden area was perfect for just lounging around. My only complaint is that there were a few mosquitoes in the evening – bring your own spray! Other than that, the staff were really attentive, and they even set up a bonfire for us which my kids loved. Not totally perfect but definitely worth the trip.</div>

                        <summary>How far in advance should we book, and what is the reservation process?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We recommend booking at least 1 to 2 months in advance, especially if you plan to stay during weekends, holidays, or the summer season, as dates fill up quickly. To reserve, simply contact us through our website or phone. A 50% down payment is required to secure your booking, with the balance payable upon check-in. After confirming your reservation, we’ll send you a booking confirmation and guidelines for your stay. If you have special requests, please let us know during the booking process so we can accommodate your needs.</div>
