However, we can sometimes accommodate last-minute bookings if the date is available. For larger events like weddings or corporate gatherings, early reservation ensures your preferred date and allows adequate time for planning."

However, if your event involves external suppliers (like fireworks, live bands, or outside catering), certain permits or clearances may be needed. Our team can guide you regarding local requirements and assist you with the necessary paperwork for Angeles City if needed."

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">We booked Aces Private Resort for my parents’ 40th anniversary last September. The place is really private, which was exactly what our family wanted. The staff was friendly and helped us set up decorations the night before — they even lent us some extra tables when our caterer was short. Pool was clean, rooms were spacious (though one AC was a little noisy, but they sent someone to fix it quickly). My parents loved the view at sunset. It’s not a cheap venue but worth the splurge for a special occasion. We made a lot of memories here. Highly recommended for family events!</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">We held our company team-building at Aces last month. The place is legit nice, with a big pool and plenty of space for activities. Our group (about 30 ppl) fit comfortably. There were a few hiccups with the speaker system not working at first, but their staff was quick to sort it out. A bit of a drive from Manila, but Angeles is always way less traffic. Wish there were more parking slots though. Overall, solid spot for private events.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Booked this resort for my son’s 18th birthday last May. Loved that it was exclusive and we had the whole place to ourselves. The resort was super clean and the kitchen area made it easy for us to prepare food. Pool lights at night were a hit with the teens. Only downside was that the WiFi barely reached the rooms, which some of the guests complained about, but honestly, it was nice seeing everyone disconnect for a while. Would use them again for family gatherings.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">For most private events such as birthdays, weddings, or corporate retreats, no special permits are required from the city if held within our premises. However, if your event involves external suppliers (like fireworks, live bands, or outside catering), certain permits or clearances may be needed. Our team can guide you regarding local requirements and assist you with the necessary paperwork for Angeles City if needed.</div>
